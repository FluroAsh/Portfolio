## PURPOSE
---------------------
The purpose of this website is to showcase my abilities as a developer and serve as the foundation for additional content (mainly blogs, but also developments in my portfolio). 

It will also serve as the foundation for future iterations as I learn new skills and look to incorporate them into he sites functionality.


## FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES
---------------------
The websites functionality and features are predominately centered around navigation and ease of accessibility. The overall goal was to reduce the amount of clicks the user has to make as-well as provide a consistent theme.

*(For Clarity, within the scope of the current websites implementation mobile and tablet media breakpoints operate indistinguishably with some minor differences)*

#### Functionality & Features
1. Mobile & Laptop Navigation Menu
2. Blog Functionality
    - Image links to individual posts 
    - Author and date details
3.  Object used to view resume PDF within browser window
    - Mobile button implementation used to download PDF copy to your device
4. Formspree.io API integrated with website contact form
    - Contact form forwards details (name, email, subject & message) via formspree API to designated email
5. Buttons used throughout to link content to appropriate pages
   - eg. from the landing page to the contact/portfolio page
6. External links to respective social media accounts


## SITEMAP
---------------------
The overarching site structure is fairly typical of most portfolio websites. A **landing page** to give the user a brief overview of what they can expect to find, a **blog** with content and further reading should the user be interested, a **portfolio page** to display skills and previous work completed, a **resume page** to give access to a formal copy of work experience and further information and lastly the **contact page** to give the user a method of contact direct to me (the website owner).
